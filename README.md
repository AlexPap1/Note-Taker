## 🖊️ Description 🖊️
<br />
User Story: AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
<br />
This repo redirects the user from a home page to a Heroku page that allows the user to add tasks with a title and description which will save to the page server. The save option only appears when content is added to both fields. These tasks can be reviewed by clicking them, and the plus icon will allow the user to add more tasks from there. The user can also use the delete button to remove tasks that have been completed.
